# Table Column Header Wrapping Improvements

## Overview

Enhanced the function analysis table column headers to wrap at every "/" character for improved readability when multiple files are selected.

## Key Improvement

### Problem

When multiple files are selected, column headers became very wide and difficult to read, especially with deep file paths like:

```
scan-functions-report-app-2025-06-29_14-23-26/app/dashboard/settings/profile/page.tsx
```

### Solution

Headers now wrap at every "/" character, creating a vertical stack that's much more readable:

#### Before (wrapped every directory group):

```
app/dashboard/settings/
profile/page.tsx
```

#### After (wrapped at every "/"):

```
app/
dashboard/
settings/
profile/
page.tsx
```

## Implementation Details

### Path Processing Logic

```typescript
// Split the path at every "/" for individual line display
const pathParts = pathOnly.split("/");
const fileName = pathParts.pop() || pathOnly;

const renderWrappedPath = () => {
  if (pathParts.length === 0) {
    // Root level file - just show the filename
    return <div className="font-medium break-words text-center">{fileName}</div>;
  }

  // Multi-level path - show each part on a new line
  return (
    <div className="text-center">
      {pathParts.map((part, index) => (
        <div key={index} className="text-[10px] leading-tight text-muted-foreground">
          {part}/
        </div>
      ))}
      <div className="font-medium break-words text-xs">{fileName}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Visual Design

- **Path segments**: Each directory shown on its own line with "/" suffix
- **Font sizing**: Path segments use smaller font (10px) to save space
- **Filename emphasis**: Final filename uses slightly larger font (12px) and bold weight
- **Color hierarchy**: Path segments in muted color, filename in primary color
- **Highlighting support**: All elements adapt colors when column is highlighted

## Benefits

### Improved Readability

- **Vertical layout**: Each path segment is clearly separated
- **Consistent width**: Column headers maintain reasonable width regardless of path depth
- **Better scanning**: Easy to identify file locations at a glance

### Space Efficiency

- **Compact display**: Narrow columns allow more files to be visible
- **Scalable design**: Works well with both shallow and deep file paths
- **Responsive behavior**: Adapts to different table widths

### User Experience

- **Faster identification**: Quickly locate specific files and their directory structure
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Clear visual hierarchy makes scanning effortless
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, organized display suitable for complex analysis

## Examples

### Root Files

```
page.tsx
```

### Single Directory

```
auth/
login.tsx
```

### Deep Nesting

```
app/
dashboard/
settings/
profile/
edit/
page.tsx
```

### Component Files

```
components/
ui/
forms/
input/
text-field.tsx
```

## Technical Notes

- Maintains full tooltip support showing the complete original path
- All sorting and filtering functionality continues to work with full display names
- Highlighting behavior adapts to the new multi-line layout
- Backward compatible with existing data structures and APIs
