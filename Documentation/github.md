To fix your project so it works correctly on GitHub Pages, you need to ensure that the static assets (CSS, JS, etc.) are served from the correct paths. Since GitHub Pages serves your app from a subdirectory (e.g., /finance-tracker), you need to adjust the paths to ensure they are accessible.

Hereâ€™s how to fix your project based on the provided information:

1. Use Relative Paths for Static Assets
By default, Next.js generates static assets in the _next/static folder. On GitHub Pages, these assets may not be accessible because they are served from /finance-tracker/_next/static/.... To fix this, you can move or copy the _next/static folder to a more accessible path (e.g., /static) and update the references in your HTML and JS files.

Steps:
Update next.config.ts to Use Relative Paths: Modify your next.config.ts to ensure that the static assets are served correctly:

    const nextConfig = {
    output: 'export', // Enables static export
    basePath: '/finance-tracker', // Matches your GitHub repository name
    trailingSlash: true, // Ensures proper routing for static files
    assetPrefix: '/finance-tracker/', // Ensures static assets use the correct prefix
    };

module.exports = nextConfig;

assetPrefix: '/finance-tracker/': Ensures that all static assets are prefixed with /finance-tracker.
Rebuild the App: Run the following command to rebuild the app with the updated configuration:

    npm run build

Verify the Output: After the build, check the out directory. The _next/static folder should now be prefixed with /finance-tracker.

2. Manually Move or Copy Static Files
If the static files are still not accessible, you can manually move or copy them to a more accessible path.

Steps:
Move the _next/static Folder: After building the app, move the _next/static folder to a more accessible path (e.g., /static):

    mv out/_next/static out/static

Update References in HTML and JS Files: Update the references to the static files in your HTML and JS files. For example:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/finance-tracker/static/css/d75bf3bb3170fb65.css">

You can use a script or a text editor to replace all occurrences of _next/static with static.

3. Automate the Process
To automate the process of moving static files and updating references, you can use a script. Add the following script to your package.json:


    "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "postbuild": "mv out/_next/static out/static && find out -type f -exec sed -i 's/_next\\/static/static/g' {} +"
    }

postbuild: Moves the _next/static folder to /static and updates all references in the out directory.
Run the build command:

    npm run build

4. Redeploy the App
After fixing the paths, redeploy the app to GitHub Pages:

    git add out -f
    git commit -m "Fix static asset paths for GitHub Pages"
    git subtree push --prefix out origin gh-pages

5. Verify the Deployment
Open your app in the browser at:

    https://carlosvelosos.github.io/finance-tracker/

Check the browser's developer tools (Network tab) to ensure that all static assets (CSS, JS, etc.) are being loaded correctly.

Summary:
Update next.config.ts to include assetPrefix: '/finance-tracker/'.
Rebuild the app using npm run build.
Move or copy the _next/static folder to /static and update references.
Automate the process with a postbuild script in package.json.
Redeploy the app to GitHub Pages.
This should resolve the issue and ensure that your app works correctly on GitHub Pages.




    npm run build
    git add out -f
    git commit -m "Fix email redirect URL for magic link login"
    git subtree push --prefix out origin gh-pages


Verify Deployment
When you build and deploy the app for production (e.g., to GitHub Pages), the basePath and assetPrefix will still be applied correctly.

To test the production build locally, you can run:

    npm run build
    npx serve out

This will serve the static files from the out directory, simulating the production environment.
