I see that you're getting a warning about multiple lockfiles being found in your project, which is related to using pnpm as the package manager. This typically happens when you have both package-lock.json (npm) and pnpm-lock.yaml (pnpm) files in your project.
Let me help you fix this by:
First checking what lock files exist in your project
Then removing the unnecessary lock files
Ensuring the correct package manager configuration
Let me check your project directory first:
I can see that you have both package-lock.json and pnpm-lock.yaml files in your project. Since you're using pnpm as your package manager, we should:
Remove the package-lock.json file
Keep the pnpm-lock.yaml file
Let me help you remove the npm lock file:
Now that we've removed the npm lock file, the warning should be resolved. Here are some additional recommendations to ensure you don't run into this issue again:
Make sure you always use pnpm commands for package management:
Use pnpm install instead of npm install
Use pnpm add <package> instead of npm install <package>
Use pnpm remove <package> instead of npm uninstall <package>
You might want to add package-lock.json to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being accidentally committed in the future.
The warning should now be gone. You can continue using your project with pnpm as the package manager. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
