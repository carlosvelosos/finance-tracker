## Known Limitations

1. **Browser-based File System Access:** Uses API routes since browser can't access file system directly
2. **Rate Limiting:** Gmail API has rate limits - handled with delays between batches
3. **Large Date Ranges:** Very large gaps (> 6 months) may take time to process

---

## Debug Checklist

If issues occur, check:

1. **Console Errors:** Open browser DevTools console
2. **API Route Logs:** Check terminal running `npm run dev`
3. **File Permissions:** Ensure write access to `privat/data/email`
4. **Environment Variables:** Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY`
5. **File System:** Check if directory and files exist

---

## Success Metrics

After all tests pass:

- ✅ Migration runs successfully
- ✅ Smart Fetching syncs new emails
- ✅ Files are organized monthly
- ✅ No duplicates exist
- ✅ Console logs are helpful
- ✅ Error handling works
- ✅ UI is responsive and intuitive
- ✅ Integration with existing features works

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **User Acceptance Testing:** Have actual users test the feature
2. **Performance Testing:** Test with 1000+ emails
3. **Documentation Update:** Update user guide with Smart Fetching instructions
4. **Deployment:** Deploy to production
5. **Monitoring:** Monitor for errors in production
