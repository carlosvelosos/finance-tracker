Ok, let's go with the junction table approac. Give me more detals about this option. I have never heard about it. How does it works?

# The Junction Table Approach: A Comprehensive Guide
## What is a Junction Table?
A junction table (also called a bridge table, join table, or associative table) is a database design pattern used to implement many-to-many relationships between two or more entities. In your case, it will create a relationship between users and transactions.

## Why Use a Junction Table?
1. Database Normalization: It follows proper database design principles
2. Flexibility: Easily add/remove access without modifying the original tables
3. Performance: Optimized for queries with proper indexing
4. Scalability: Works efficiently even with thousands of users or transactions
5. Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns in your database design

## How Junction Tables Work
Think of a junction table as a "membership list" that answers the question: "Which users have access to which transactions?"

Here's a visual representation:

    Users Table                 Junction Table                    Transactions Table
    +------------+              +------------------+             +----------------+
    | user_id    |<----------->| user_id          |<----------->| transaction_id |
    | email      |              | transaction_id   |             | description    |
    | name       |              | table_name       |             | amount         |
    +------------+              +------------------+             | date           |
                                                                +----------------+

Each row in the junction table represents one "access permission" - it connects one user to one transaction.

## Implementing the Junction Table Approach for Your Finance Tracker
Step 1: Create the Junction Table

    CREATE TABLE public.transaction_user_access (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        transaction_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        user_id UUID NOT NULL,
        table_name TEXT NOT NULL, -- To identify which transaction table (2024 or 2025)
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
        UNIQUE(transaction_id, user_id, table_name)
    );

    -- Add indexes for better query performance
    CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_user_access_user_id ON public.transaction_user_access(user_id);
    CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_user_access_transaction_table ON public.transaction_user_access(transaction_id, table_name);

Step 2: Migrate Existing Data

    -- Start a transaction for safety
    BEGIN;

    -- Add existing user access for 2024 transactions
    INSERT INTO public.transaction_user_access (transaction_id, user_id, table_name)
    SELECT 
        id, 
        user_id, 
        'Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024'
    FROM 
        public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024";

    -- Add existing user access for 2025 transactions
    INSERT INTO public.transaction_user_access (transaction_id, user_id, table_name)
    SELECT 
        id, 
        user_id, 
        'Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025'
    FROM 
        public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025";

    -- Commit the changes if everything looks good
    COMMIT;

Step 3: Add the New User to Specific Transactions

    -- Start a transaction
    BEGIN;

    -- Add the new user to 'us' or 'Amanda' transactions from 2024
    INSERT INTO public.transaction_user_access (transaction_id, user_id, table_name)
    SELECT 
        id, 
        '0a29c8db-018c-49cb-ac35-7ccf1719be2c', 
        'Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024'
    FROM 
        public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024"  -- Note the double quotes here
    WHERE 
        "Responsible" IN ('us', 'Amanda')
    ON CONFLICT (transaction_id, user_id, table_name) DO NOTHING;

    -- Add the new user to 'us' or 'Amanda' transactions from 2025
    INSERT INTO public.transaction_user_access (transaction_id, user_id, table_name)
    SELECT 
        id, 
        '0a29c8db-018c-49cb-ac35-7ccf1719be2c', 
        'Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025'
    FROM 
        public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025"  -- Note the double quotes here
    WHERE 
        "Responsible" IN ('us', 'Amanda')
    ON CONFLICT (transaction_id, user_id, table_name) DO NOTHING;

    -- Commit the changes
    COMMIT;

Step 4: Implement Row-Level Security with the Junction Table

    -- Enable RLS on your transaction tables
    ALTER TABLE public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Create policies that use the junction table for access control
    CREATE POLICY "Users can access their own transactions 2024" 
    ON public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024"
    FOR ALL
    TO authenticated
    USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM public.transaction_user_access 
        WHERE 
        transaction_id = public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024".id 
        AND table_name = 'Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024'
        AND user_id = auth.uid()
    )
    );

    CREATE POLICY "Users can access their own transactions 2025" 
    ON public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025"
    FOR ALL
    TO authenticated
    USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM public.transaction_user_access 
        WHERE 
        transaction_id = public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025".id 
        AND table_name = 'Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025'
        AND user_id = auth.uid()
    )
    );

    -- Also secure the junction table itself
    ALTER TABLE public.transaction_user_access ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    CREATE POLICY "Users can see their own access records" 
    ON public.transaction_user_access
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (user_id = auth.uid());

## How to Query Data Using the Junction Table
From JavaScript/TypeScript Client

    // Get all transactions user has access to
    const getMyTransactions = async () => {
    const { data: transactions2024, error: error2024 } = await supabase
        .from('Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024')
        .select('*')
        .order('Date', { ascending: false });
        
    const { data: transactions2025, error: error2025 } = await supabase
        .from('Brasil_transactions_agregated_2025')
        .select('*')
        .order('Date', { ascending: false });
        
    // Combine results
    return [...(transactions2024 || []), ...(transactions2025 || [])];
    };

With RLS in place, users will automatically only see transactions they have access to!

SQL Queries for Analytics/Admin

    -- Get all users who have access to a specific transaction
    SELECT u.email, u.name
    FROM auth.users u
    JOIN public.transaction_user_access tua ON u.id = tua.user_id
    WHERE 
    tua.transaction_id = 123 AND 
    tua.table_name = 'Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024';

    -- Get all transactions a specific user can access
    SELECT t.*
    FROM public."Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024" t
    JOIN public.transaction_user_access tua ON 
    t.id = tua.transaction_id AND 
    tua.table_name = 'Brasil_transactions_agregated_2024'
    WHERE tua.user_id = '2b5c5467-04e0-4820-bea9-1645821fa1b7';

## Managing Access in Your Application
Adding Access

    const grantAccessToTransaction = async (
    transactionId: number, 
    userId: string, 
    tableName: string
    ) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('transaction_user_access')
        .insert({
        transaction_id: transactionId,
        user_id: userId,
        table_name: tableName
        })
        .single();
        
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
    };

Removing Access

    const revokeAccessToTransaction = async (
    transactionId: number, 
    userId: string, 
    tableName: string
    ) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('transaction_user_access')
        .delete()
        .match({
        transaction_id: transactionId,
        user_id: userId,
        table_name: tableName
        });
        
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
    };

## Advantages Over Array-Based Approach
1. Better Query Performance: Junction tables with proper indexes outperform array operations
2. Enhanced Flexibility: Easily add metadata like "when access was granted" or "who granted access"
3. Easier Maintenance: Simple INSERT/DELETE operations vs. array manipulation
4. Better Compatibility: Works with any database tool or ORM
5. Simpler Row-Level Security: More straightforward RLS policies

## Real-World Example
To put this in perspective, imagine a shared expense between family members:

1. When a user creates a transaction, it's automatically accessible to them
2. If they mark it as "shared" or with Responsible="us", the junction table approach makes it easy to give access to family members
3. Your application's UI can show all transactions a user has access to without complex queries

This approach is ideal for your Finance Tracker application because it provides a clean, scalable way to share transaction data between family members while maintaining proper access control.
